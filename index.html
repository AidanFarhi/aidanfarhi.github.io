        <h1>Hello! 👋</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Aidan Farhi. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a Data Engineer and a student at Southern New Hampshire University.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this site is to showcase the work I completed
            as part of my computer science capstone course CS 499.
        </p>
        <h1>The Project 🗂️</h1>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to showcase my skills accross three dimensions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Design and Engineering 🖥️</li>
            <li>Algorithms and Data Structures ⚙️</li>
            <li>Databases 🛢️</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To accomplish this, I took a mobile application I had built in a previous
            course and migrated it to a fully-functional web application.
        </p>
        <h2>Step One: Code Review 📝</h2>
        <p>
            As part of the initial steps of the project, I performed an in-depth code review
            of the pre-existing mobile application.
