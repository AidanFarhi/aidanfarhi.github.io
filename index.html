        <h1>Hello! 👋</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Aidan Farhi. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a data engineer and student at Southern New Hampshire University.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have strengthened my technical abilities, refined my professional values, 
            and clarified the direction I want to pursue within the field. The process of completing my coursework and developing this ePortfolio has helped me articulate 
            not only the knowledge I have gained, but also the strengths I bring into a professional computing environment. This experience has reinforced my goals 
            as a software and data engineer while preparing me to be a more capable and employable candidate in the technology industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Collaborating in team environments was one of the earliest and most consistent themes of the program. 
            Through most of the projects and assignments, I learned how to shoulder responsibilty,
            incorporate feedback from my instructors, and build software in a way that aligns with modern development practices.
            This was especially emphasized in the Software Development Lifecycle (CS 250) course.
            In that course, I learned how to interpret user needs, break work into manageable tasks,
            prioritize effectively, communicate clearly, collaborate adaptively, and approach software 
            development with a flexible, feedback-driven mindset grounded in core Agile principles.

            Communicating with stakeholders, both technical and non-technical, was another major area of growth. Several courses,
            including Operating Platforms (CS 230), required me to translate complex computing concepts into clear explanations 
            for hypothetical clients or organizational leaders. For example, during one design assignment, 
            I converted the client's high-level request for a web-based version of their mobile game into clear technical requirements 
            and design solutions, using diagrams, organized documentation, and real-world software engineering practices to create a 
            simple, functional, and user-aligned system plan.

            Across the curriculum, I consistently strengthened my understanding of data structures and algorithms. 
            These fundamentals influenced not only the way I approached problem-solving in coursework, but 
            also how I made design decisions in my own projects. 
            The course Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design (CS 300)
            covered topics like vectors, linked lists, hash tables, binary search trees, and time/space complexity analysis of algorithms.

            My coursework in software engineering and database systems formed the backbone of my professional development. 
            Through assignments involving object-oriented design, API development, SQL schema creation, and full-stack application structure, 
            I learned how to move systematically from requirements to implementation. I practiced writing modular code, 
            applying design patterns, and building systems that separate concerns cleanly. This is a skill that directly influenced 
            how I architected my capstone project. Outside the classroom, I expanded these skills by developing personal applications, 
            experimenting with various backend frameworks, and gaining experience with cloud deployment environments.
            Courses that were relevant in this area were 
            Client/Server Development (CS 340), 
            System Analysis and Design (CS 255),
            Foundation in Application Development (IT 145), and 
            Introduction to Structered Database Environments (DAD 220).

            Security was another critical area emphasized throughout the program. I learned how to identify and 
            anticipate potential vulnerabilities, apply secure coding practices, and evaluate the risks associated 
            with authentication, data storage, and user interactions.
            Many of these topics were covered in Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance (CS 320) and
            Software Security (CS 305).
            Implementing secure password hashing, session management, and input validation in my projects, particularly 
            in my capstone, helped me adopt a security-first mindset. Rather than treating security as a secondary concern, 
            I learned to integrate it as a core part of software design.

        <p>
            As a whole, this portfolio presents a cohesive narrative of my development: from learning core concepts, 
            to applying them in increasingly sophisticated projects, to ultimately building a production-ready 
            system in my capstone project that integrates software engineering, data management, security, and user-centered design. 
        </p>
        <h1>The Capstone Project: Weight Tracker 📈</h1>
        <p>
            All of the learning, skills, and techniques I absorbed during the course of the program culminate
            in my capstone project: Weight Tracker.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of the app is to provide users an simple, cross-plaftorm, and intuitive way to track their
            weight over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I achieved this by converting an existing artifact I built in the course Mobile Architecture and Programming (CS 360)
            to a full-stack web application.
        </p>
        <p>
            In doing so, I showcase my skills in these three core areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Design and Engineering 🖥️</li>
            <li>Algorithms and Data Structures ⚙️</li>
            <li>Databases 🛢️</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Code Review of Existing Artifact: The Mobile Application 📝</h1>
        <p>
            As part of the initial steps of the project, I performed an in-depth code review
            of the pre-existing mobile application which I migrated to a web app.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the video of the code review:</p>

        <p>The application was built loosely following the <b>Controller</b>-<b>Service</b>-<b>Repository</b> pattern.</p>
        <p>
            The <b>Controller</b> layer handles recieving and responding to requests, interacting with the Service layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Service</b> layer is where the bulk of the business logic resides, interacting with the Controller and Repository layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Repository</b> layer handles all interactions with the database. It interfaces with the Service layer.

        <p>Here is the tech stack that I used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Golang<img class="small-icon" src="images/golang_icon.png" alt="golang  icon"></li>
            <li>PosgreSQL<img class="small-icon" src="images/postgres_icon.png" alt="pg icon"></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            I also made sure to write unit tests for the service layer. By doing so, I validated that the
            core business logic is functioning as expected. I achieved 95% code coverage for the service package.

            One of the course outcomes was this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential 
                vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            I was able to demonstrate growth in this area by ensuring that all user interactions with the application are
            secured by session-based authorization. I also made sure that all passwords are encrypted before being stored in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the overall application implementation demonstrates key skills outlined in this course outcome:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose 
                of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
            </i>
        </p>
        <h1>Algorithms and Data Structures ⚙️</h1>
        <p>
            While building out the application, I leveraged my skills in Algorithms and Data Structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            This aligns with the following course outcome:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science 
                practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            On the backend, one of the core structures is the WeightEntry struct, 
            which represents a single database row and is collected into Go slices ([]WeightEntry) 
            that serve as the primary in-memory containers.
            These are dynamic arrays that grow amortized O(1) on append. 
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img class="large-image" src="images/wt_ds_algo.png" alt="arch">
        </div>
        <p>
            In the database layer, PostgreSQL handles the heavy work. 
            The ROW_NUMBER() window function uses internal sorting (O(n log n)) 
            over partitions to deduplicate entries by date, while B-tree indexes support efficient 
            lookups on filters and ORDER BY clauses. On the frontend, the fetched weight
            entries become arrays of plain JavaScript objects, which are then sorted with 
            an O(n log n) comparison sort, mapped to labels and values in O(n), and scanned for min/max in O(n). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Chart.js ultimately transforms these arrays into its own typed arrays and drawing instructions 
            for canvas rendering. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Across the whole app, the dominant structures are dynamic arrays, structs, 
            and indexed relational tables, and the main algorithms involve sorting, window functions, 
            and linear array transformations.
        </p>
        <h1>Databases 🛢️</h1>
        <p>
            The PostgreSQL database is hosted on Neon, which provides a fast, cloud-native platform with built-in scalability 
            and branching capabilities. Each table in the schema plays a clear role in maintaining application integrity.
            I used the pgx library to ensure efficient, type-safe communication between the Go server and the database,
            allowing for clean queries, robust error handling, and high performance across all data operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the tables and their descriptions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>user_account - stores core identity and authentication data.</li>
            <li>user_session - tracks active sessions to support secure, cookie-based login flows.</li>
            <li>weight_entry - captures all user-submitted weight records for analysis and display. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is the ERD showing the tables and relationships:</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img class="large-image" src="images/wt_db_erd.png" alt="arch">
        </div>
        <p>
            Here are the SQL statements I used to create the tables:
        </p>
        {% highlight sql %}
        CREATE TABLE user_account (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            email TEXT UNIQUE,
            password TEXT
        );

        CREATE TABLE weight_entry (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            user_account_id INT REFERENCES user_account(id),
            weight INT,
            entry_date TIMESTAMP,
            category TEXT
        );

        CREATE TABLE user_session (
            id TEXT UNIQUE,
            user_account_id INT REFERENCES user_account(id)
