        <h1>Hello! 👋</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Aidan Farhi. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a data engineer and student at Southern New Hampshire University.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my computer science program, I have developed several skills relevant to software engineering and professional software development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the skills that I have gained a fundemental grasp of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Design and Engineering 🖥️</li>
            <li>Algorithms and Data Structures ⚙️</li>
            <li>Databases 🛢️</li>
        </ul>
        <p>    
            My technical journey began with mobile application development using Java and the Android SDK.
            These were used to build an app that helped users track their weight over time.
            Through the capstone, I expanded those skills by transforming this single-platform mobile app into a 
            fully deployed, cross-platform web application built with Go, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL.
        </p>
        <p>
            By successfully completing this capstone, and the bulk of the computer science program,
            I have increased my depth of knowledge in the field.
            This will assist me as I navigate my current role as a data engineer and whatever
            future endeavors aligned with this field I end up pursuing.
        </p>
        <h1>Code Review of Existing Mobile Application 📝</h1>
        <p>
            As part of the initial steps of the project, I performed an in-depth code review
            of the pre-existing mobile application which I migrated to a web app.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the video of the code review:</p>

            allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
        <p>Here are the tools I used to build the original mobile app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Java<img class="small-icon" src="images/java_icon.png" alt="java icon"></li>

            <li>Gradle<img class="small-icon" src="images/gradle_icon.png" alt="java icon"></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some screenshots of the original mobile application:</p>

        <h1>Enhanced Version of Mobile App ✨</h1>
        <p>
            The enhanced version of the project runs as a web application.
            This means it is more accessable and portable accross platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of the application is to help users track their weight over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I call it "Weight Tracker"

        <h1>Software Design and Engineering 🖥️</h1>
        <p>The application was built loosely following the <b>Controller</b>-<b>Service</b>-<b>Repository</b> pattern.</p>
        <p>
            The <b>Controller</b> layer handles recieving and responding to requests, interacting with the Service layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Service</b> layer is where the bulk of the business logic resides, interacting with the Controller and Repository layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Repository</b> layer handles all interactions with the database. It interfaces with the Service layer.
        </p>

        <p>Architecturally, it is a monolith hosted on Heroku that has a separate DB instance provisioned using Neon.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Here is the tech stack that I used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Golang<img class="small-icon" src="images/golang_icon.png" alt="golang  icon"></li>
            <li>PosgreSQL<img class="small-icon" src="images/postgres_icon.png" alt="pg icon"></li>
            <li>JavaScript<img class="small-icon" src="images/js_icon.png" alt="js icon"></li>
            <li>HTML<img class="small-icon" src="images/html_icon.png" alt="java icon"></li>
            <li>CSS<img class="small-icon" src="images/css_icon.png" alt="css icon"></li>
            <li>Heroku<img class="small-icon" src="images/heroku_icon.svg" alt="heroku icon"></li>
            <li>Neon<img class="small-icon" src="images/neon_icon.png" alt="neon icon"></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I also made sure to write unit tests for the service layer. By doing so, I validated that the
            core business logic is functioning as expected. I achieved 95% code coverage for the service package.
        </p>

            One of the course outcomes was this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential 
                vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            I was able to demonstrate growth in this area by ensuring that all user interactions with the application are
            secured by session-based authorization. I also made sure that all passwords are encrypted before being stored in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the overall application implementation demonstrates key skills outlined in this course outcome:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose 
                of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
            </i>
        </p>
        <h1>Algorithms and Data Structures ⚙️</h1>
        <p>
            While building out the application, I leveraged my skills in Algorithms and Data Structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            This aligns with the following course outcome:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science 
                practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            On the backend, one of the core structures is the WeightEntry struct, 
            which represents a single database row and is collected into Go slices ([]WeightEntry) 
            that serve as the primary in-memory containers.
            These are dynamic arrays that grow amortized O(1) on append. 
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img class="large-image" src="images/wt_ds_algo.png" alt="arch">
        </div>
        <p>
            The service and repository layers are thin structs holding pointers (*WeightRepo, *pgxpool.Pool) that act 
            as dependency-injected components rather than complex data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the database layer, PostgreSQL handles the heavy work. 
            The ROW_NUMBER() window function uses internal sorting (O(n log n)) 
            over partitions to deduplicate entries by date, while B-tree indexes support efficient 
            lookups on filters and ORDER BY clauses. On the frontend, the fetched weight
            entries become arrays of plain JavaScript objects, which are then sorted with 
            an O(n log n) comparison sort, mapped to labels and values in O(n), and scanned for min/max in O(n). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Chart.js ultimately transforms these arrays into its own typed arrays and drawing instructions 
            for canvas rendering. Across the whole app, the dominant structures are dynamic arrays, structs, 
            and indexed relational tables, and the main algorithms involve sorting, window functions, 
            and linear array transformations.
        </p>
        <h1>Databases 🛢️</h1>
        <p>
            The database has been implemented using PostgreSQL. 
            I have created three separate tables to handle all application data: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>user_account - holds all user account information</li>
            <li>user_session - holds all user session data.</li>
            <li>weight_entry - contains all weight entry data. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is the ERD showing the tables and relationships:</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img class="large-image" src="images/wt_db_erd.png" alt="arch">
        </div>
        <p>
            The pgx library is used to facilitate interaction between the server-side layer and the PostgreSQL database.
